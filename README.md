## Performance Optimization

### Tips for Large Applications

1. **Lazy Loading**: Load async operations only when needed to reduce initial load time.
2. **Memoization**: Use memoized callbacks for async actions to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
3. **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully in the component tree.

By following these practices, you can ensure that your application remains performant even with a large number of async operations.
